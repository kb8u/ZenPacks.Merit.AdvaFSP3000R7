Provides monitoring of FSP3000R7 optical transport systems manufactured by Adva
Optical Networking.

This is a subset of the functionality provided by Adva's proprietary Network
Management System.  Most alerts are implemented and optical signal strength
is graphed.  Most blade types will be detected when modeling a system.  Alerts
severities match Adva's NMS severity levels.
